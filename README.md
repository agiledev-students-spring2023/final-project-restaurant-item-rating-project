# Project Repository

This repository will be used for team projects.

Several sets of instructions are included in this repository. They should each be treated as separate assignments with their own due dates and sets of requirements.

1. See the [App Map & Wireframes](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md) and [Prototyping](./instructions-0b-prototyping.md) instructions for the requirements of the initial user experience design of the app.

1. Delete the contents of this file and replace with the contents of a proper README.md, as described in the [project setup instructions](./instructions-0c-project-setup.md)

1. See the [Sprint Planning instructions](instructions-0d-sprint-planning.md) for the requirements of Sprint Planning for each Sprint.

1. See the [Front-End Development instructions](./instructions-1-front-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Front-End Development.

1. See the [Back-End Development instructions](./instructions-2-back-end.md) for the requirements of the initial Back-End Development.

1. See the [Database Integration instructions](./instructions-3-database.md) for the requirements of integrating a database into the back-end.

1. See the [Deployment instructions](./instructions-4-deployment.md) for the requirements of deploying an app.

## Project Description:
This application will allow users to rate individual items at restaurants. There are two current problem with review systems like Google Reviews (which is excellent) and Yelp: (1) you can rate restaurants but not individual food items, and (2) people don't know what's "the best" thing to order at a restaurant unless by word of mouth. On the first point, critically, things such as service and ambience will lower the overall rating of the restaurant even if the food is fire (delicious). Our application solves this problem by focusing our ratings exclusively on the dishes themselves. On the second point, our application enables users, before going to or at a restaurant, to quickly lookup the best-rated items. Our target market is foodies and those with allergies. 

In 2 months we want this project to be fully functional.

## Project History:
This application idea was the creation of five excited foodies. We bonded on the shared experience of craving a dish but not knowing which restaurant serves the best version of that dish. We are solving this issue through our application!

## Instructions for Building and Testing:

PRIOR TO MAKING ANY PUSH REQUESTS: make sure to enter the command 'git pull' into your terminal, then stage your changes and push your code with a detailed message regarding the changes made.

1. Create a well-defined strategy to tackle the feature being built.
2. Analyze and anticipate potential issues in the code.
3. Code the back-end/server technology (run a code review process periodically).
4. Have a teammate check your code!
5. Create the application programming interface.
6. Have a teammate check your code!
7. Develop the mobile app front-end or "client-side" interface (run a code review process periodically).
8. Developer requests a review of the code.
9. Run documentation testing.
